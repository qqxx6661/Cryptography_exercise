\section{Access control}
\label{sec:ac}


\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}1.List and briefly define categories of security services.

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}Access control: The prevention of unauthorized use of a resource (i.e., this service controls who can have access to a resource, under what conditions access can occur, and what those accessing the resource are allowed to do).

\hspace{1cm}Data confidentiality: The protection of data from unauthorized disclosure.

\hspace{1cm}Data integrity: The assurance that data received are exactly as sent by an authorized entity (i.e., contain no modification, insertion, deletion, or replay).

\hspace{1cm}Non-repudiation: Provides protection against denial by one of the entities involved in a communication of having participated in all or part of the communication.

\hspace{1cm}Availability service: The property of a system or a system resource being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized system entity, according to performance specifications for the system (i.e., a system is available if it provides services according to the system design whenever users request them).
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}2.List the common implementation methods of Access control.

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}Access Control Table

\hspace{1cm}Access Capability Table

\hspace{1cm}Authorization Relationship Table
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}3.List four techniques used by firewalls to control access and enforce a security policy.

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}The four techniques used by firewalls to control access and enforce a security policy are Service control, Direction control, User control and Behavior control.

\hspace{1cm}Service control regulates the types of Internet services that can be accessed inbound or outbound which can be done by funneling traffic on the basis of an IP address, protocol or port numbers. The can be done by making use of proxy software or host server software.

\hspace{1cm}Direction control regulates the direction in which particular service requests may be initialized and are allowed to flow via through the firewall.

\hspace{1cm}A User control manages or authorizes admission to a service according to which entity is trying to access that specified service. A User control typically applied to access inside a perimeter but also can be applied to incoming external traffic.

\hspace{1cm}Finally there is Behavior control which manages how specific services are used such as filtering of emails.
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}4.What is the access pattern of a file?

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}Read-copy

\hspace{1cm}Write-delete

\hspace{1cm}Execute

\hspace{1cm}Null
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}5.What is ESP?

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}ESP- encapsulating security payload provides authentication, integrity and confidentiality, which protect against data tempering and provide message content protection. IPSec provides standard algorithms, such as SHA and MD5.
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}6.Answer the following questions about access control.

\hspace{1cm}a.What are the models of the RBAC96 model cluster?

\hspace{1cm}b.What are the main security features and differences for each model?

\hspace{1cm}c.How to use RBAC96 to achieve mandatory access control?

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}a.RBAC96 is a model family, including RBAC0 ~ RBAC3 four conceptual models;

\hspace{1cm}b.RBAC 0 defines the minimum requirements for any system that fully supports the RABC concept;RBAC1 increased the role of the classification concept, a role can be inherited from another role permissions;RBAC2 adds some restrictions, emphasizing some of the configuration limitations in the different components of RBAC.

\hspace{1cm}c.RBAC96 achieves mandatory access control through inheritance and mutual exclusion of roles by adding roles and restricting roles.
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}7.Briefly describe the problem of Discretionary Access control and Mandatory Access control.

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}Discretionary Access control:

\hspace{1cm}Small configuration granularity

\hspace{1cm}Large configuration workload

\hspace{1cm}Low efficiency

\hspace{1cm}Mandatory Access control:

\hspace{1cm}Large configuration granularity

\hspace{1cm}Lack of flexibility
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}8.The resource to be protected is defined as an access control packet, and what does the access control packet include?

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}Resource name and the owner's identifier

\hspace{1cm}Default access rights

\hspace{1cm}User, and user group privileges list

\hspace{1cm}Operation allowing resource owner add new and available data

\hspace{1cm}Audit data
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}9.What are the three elements of access control?

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}Subject: An entity that makes a request or request, is the initiator of the action, but not necessarily the actor of the action. A principal can be an entity (such as a process, a job, or a program) that acts on the user or any other proxy user. We specify that an entity (Entity) represents a computer resource (physical device, data file, memory, or process) or a valid user.

\hspace{1cm}Object: is to accept other entities to access the passive entity, abbreviated as O. The concept of the object is also very broad, all can be manipulated information, resources, objects can be considered objects. In the information society, the object can be information, documents, records, such as the collection can also be the hardware on the network facilities, wireless communication terminal, or even an object can contain another object.

\hspace{1cm}Control strategy: is the subject of the operation of the object set and constraint conditions set, abbreviated KS. In brief, the control strategy is the set of access rules of the subject, which directly defines the action of the subject and the condition of the object to the subject. Access policy reflects an authorization behavior, that is, object permission to the subject, this permission does not go beyond the rule set, which is given.
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}10.List three basic principles of Access Control.

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}Least privilege principle

\hspace{1cm}Multi-person responsible principle

\hspace{1cm}Duty separation principle
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}11.List the common access control models.

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}DAC Model: Discretionary Access Control Model

\hspace{1cm}MAC Model: Mandatory Access Control Model

\hspace{1cm}RBAC Model: Role-based Access Model

\hspace{1cm}TBAC Model: Task-based Access Control Model

\hspace{1cm}OBAC Model: Object-based Access Control Model

\hspace{1cm}Access control

\hspace{1cm}Connectionless integrity

\hspace{1cm}Data origin authentication

\hspace{1cm}Rejection of replayed packet

\hspace{1cm}Confidentiality

\hspace{1cm}Limited traffic for Confidentiality
\newline

\textbf{Question}:

\hspace{1cm}7.What aspects of security do Cryptography provide for the storage and transmission of digital information?

\textbf{Answer}:

\hspace{1cm}Confidentiality: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.

\hspace{1cm}Integrity: Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, including ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity. A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.

\hspace{1cm}Identification: Once detection has been achieved, identify the specific virus that has infected a program.

\hspace{1cm}Non-repudiation: Non-repudiation prevents either sender or receiver from denying a transmitted message. Thus, when a message is sent, the receiver can prove that the alleged
sender in fact sent the message. Similarly, when a message is received, the sender can
prove that the alleged receiver in fact received the message.
